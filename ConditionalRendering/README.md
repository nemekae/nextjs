Conditional Rendering in React

In this exercise, you will practice different ways to render JSX conditionally in React components.

Step 1: Create a Weather Component with if, else if, and else
Create a new file called Weather.jsx.

Inside this file, create a functional component called Weather.
The component should:

Take a temperature prop.

Use if, else if, and else statements to conditionally render different messages based on the temperature value:

If the temperature is below 15, display: "It's cold outside!"

If the temperature is between 15 and 25, display: "It's nice outside!"

If the temperature is above 25, display: "It's hot outside!"



Step 2: Create a UserStatus Component with the && Operator
Create a new file called UserStatus.jsx.

Inside this file, create a functional component called UserStatus.
The component should:

Take two boolean props loggedIn, isAdmin

Use the && operator to display a message for Admin & Normal User:

If loggedIn is true and isAdmin display: "Welcome Admin!"

If it's just loggedIn and not admin then display "Welcome User".



Step 3: Create a Greeting Component with a Ternary Operator

Create a new file called Greeting.jsx.

Inside this file, create a functional component called Greeting.
The component should:

Take a timeOfDay prop (e.g., "morning", "afternoon", or "evening").

Use the ternary operator to conditionally display different 
greetings based on the time of day:

If timeOfDay is "morning", display: "Good morning!"

If timeOfDay is "afternoon", display: "Good afternoon!"



Step 4: Render the Components in App.jsx

In your App.jsx file, import the Weather, UserStatus, and Greeting components:
